# Data-Processing-Storage

How to run: \n
In the terminal, run "javac Main.java" and then "java Main". \n
The Main function implements the commands detailed in the assignment instructions and outputs results of each command to the terminal, but these commands can be added to, deleted, and/or modified accordingly. \n
No other setup is required. 

How assignment should be modified: \n
The current assignment is a great way to visualize the transaction process in relational databases. However, some modifications to improve the assignment would be to add to the instructions specfically what each command should output to the user, if applicable. In addition, I think it would be helpful for the student to create a few unit test cases for each function to show that each is returning the correct values or throwing errors when necessary, instead of having to manually test it. This would be useful for the assignment and also benficial to learn and practice as well. Other than that,the assignment was fun, interesting, and educational.
